# üéÆ Studio Generations (WiP)

**Polaris Game Dev Sim** is a game development simulation game, built using **PolarisKit**, a lightweight modular starter kit for building 2D games with Pygame.  
Polaris Game Dev Sim is designed to be fully replayable, strategic, and a complete example of what PolarisKit can power.

This is a passion project by **Polaris Studios**, designed to explore **strategy, creativity, and history**, and to serve as a showcase for **PolarisKit** and clean game architecture.

The game will feature a full historical timeline (1958 ‚Üí 2059), unique meta progression, and a rich time-management core loop.

## üí° Core Concept

- Game starts in **1958**, year of the first commercial video game.
- The studio continues through **2059**, a full century of industry history.
- Every year, players choose how to spend their time, balancing staff growth, game releases, studio upgrades, and long-term goals.

**Key design goal:** Slow, meaningful progression.

## üïπÔ∏è Planned Core Loop

Each year, the player starts with 52 weeks.

At each decision point, they choose how to spend their weeks:

- **Train Staff** (4 weeks): Improve staff stats, diminishing returns if repeated
- **Advertise Company** (8 weeks): Grow fanbase
- **Create Small Game** (12 weeks): Build revenue and fans
- **Relax Staff** (16 weeks): Fully reset fatigue and motivation
- **Create Big Game** (24 weeks): High risk/reward project
- **Create Console** (52 weeks): Launch your own platform
- **Prototype New Tech** (6 weeks): Unlock new features or bonuses
- **Attend Conference** (1 week): Random small bonus (fans, hype, contacts)

Year ends ‚Üí player reviews results ‚Üí new year begins.
